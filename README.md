# OTP-VERIFICATION
OTP Verification is the process of verifying a user by sending a unique password so that the user can be verified before completing a registration or payment process. 
Most of the time, we get an OTP when we make an online payment, or when we forget our password, or when creating an account on any online platform. 
Thus, the sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a user by sending a unique password.
This application has been created with the help of Python.
The following steps have been used along with loading necessary python libraries while making this application-:

1.Firstly, created a 6-digit random number and stored the number in a variable.
2.Then wrote a program to send emails
3.When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message
4.Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the userâ€™s email and then for the OTP that the user has received.
